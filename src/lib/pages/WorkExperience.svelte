      Collaborated with the Xbox Live team (PlayFab) to architect and implement
      a new event-driven model for leaderboards and player statistics using
      PlayStream, developing both the React.js front-end and the C# back-end
      integration. I engineered and deployed event-driven processing via
      WebHooks, leveraging Azure CosmosDB and Kusto for scalable storage and
      analytics, and managed applications using Kubernetes and Azure DevOps. The
      feature was successfully released and documented, leading to rapid
      adoption by multiple external game studios.

      I partnered with the Xbox Live team (PlayFab) to engineer tools and
      services supporting game studios in implementing Large Language Models
      (LLMs) for automated task execution, focusing on Microsoft Semantic Kernel
      for building and optimizing AI agents. I applied advanced prompting
      techniques to integrate LLMs at scale into customer-facing products,
      designing intuitive React.js user experiences. Additionally, I drove the
      implementation of scalable deployment and monitoring pipelines for these
      LLM integrations using frameworks like Semantic Kernel and Azure OpenAI
      Services, ensuring reliability and performance.

      I delivered scalable tools and services with the Xbox Live Leaderboards
      team to enhance cross-platform player engagement for both third-party and
      first-party game titles. I combined software engineering and project
      management expertise to successfully deliver a customer engagement feature
      that notably increased retention, utilizing a hybrid cloud stack composed
      of AWS and Azure services.
